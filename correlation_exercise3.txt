##Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for complete cases and calculates the correlation 
##between sulfate and nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all variables)
## is greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. 
##If no monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0

  index <- 1;
  
  while (index <= length(files)) {
    completeCases <- complete(directory, index);
    
    if (completeCases$nobs > threshold) {
      data <- read.csv(files[index], comment.char = "");
      correlationList <- c(correlationList, cor(data$sulfate, data$nitrate, use = "complete.obs"));
